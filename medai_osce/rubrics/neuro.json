      "Observe patient throughout the exam for alertness, responsiveness, and speech patterns.",
      "Check soft touch sensation of upper extremities using cotton wisp bilaterally on shoulders (C5), forearms (C6, T1), thumbs and little fingers (C6, C8).",
      "Ask patient to identify touch location with eyes closed for upper extremities.",
      "Check soft touch sensation of lower extremities using cotton wisp bilaterally on thighs (L3), ankles (L4), dorsum of feet (L5), fifth toes (S1).",
      "Ask patient to identify touch location with eyes closed for lower extremities.",
      "Demonstrate sharp/dull stimuli on back of hand; test upper extremities bilaterally on shoulders, forearms, thumbs and little fingers.",
      "Ask patient to identify stimulus as sharp or dull with eyes closed for upper extremities.",
      "Test sharp/dull discrimination on lower extremities (thighs, ankles, dorsum of feet, fifth toes); ask patient to identify stimulus with eyes closed.",
      "Test vibration sense (upper) using tuning fork on distal interphalangeal joints of both hands; patient eyes closed.",
      "Test vibration sense (lower) using tuning fork on distal interphalangeal joints of both feet; patient eyes closed.",
      "Test proprioception (upper): move patient’s index finger up/down with eyes closed; perform bilaterally.",
      "Test proprioception (lower): move patient’s big toe up/down with eyes closed; perform bilaterally.",
      "Test biceps reflex bilaterally with reflex hammer.",
      "Test triceps reflex bilaterally with reflex hammer.",
      "Test brachioradialis reflex using broad side of reflex hammer.",
      "Test patellar reflex bilaterally.",
      "Test Achilles reflex bilaterally with flat end of reflex hammer.",
      "Test plantar response (Babinski) bilaterally using wooden end of applicator stick.",
      "Test for clonus by dorsiflexing and maintaining foot position for 2 seconds bilaterally.",
      "Test rapid alternating hand movements (pat palms and backs on thighs) bilaterally.",
      "Test rapid finger tapping bilaterally.",
      "Test point-to-point: finger to nose to examiner’s finger (multiple positions), both sides.",
      "Test point-to-point: heel to shin (patient sitting or supine).",
      "Assess normal gait: walk forward, turn, return.",
      "Assess gait on toes, heels, and tandem (heel-to-toe) walking.",
      "Perform Romberg test: patient stands with feet together, eyes closed, for 10 seconds.",
      "Perform pronator drift test: arms forward, palms up, eyes closed, check for drift and tap arms downward."
